# 404 NOT_FOUND Error Solution

## Problem
The application was showing a 404 NOT_FOUND error when trying to access the Permit Office Finder application.

## Root Cause
The frontend Next.js development server was not running. Only the backend server was running on port 3001, but the frontend application needed to be started separately.

## Solution
1. **Start the frontend development server:**
   ```bash
   cd "/Users/ekodevapps/Desktop/Permit Office Finder/frontend"
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Access the application:**
   - The frontend will automatically find an available port (in this case, port 3002)
   - Access the application at: [http://localhost:3002](http://localhost:3002)

## Additional Fixes Applied
- Fixed ESLint issues:
  - Removed unused `calculateDistance` function from `page.tsx`
  - Fixed TypeScript `any` type usage in `office-map.tsx`
  - Removed unused `PermitOffice` import from `api.ts`

## Verification
- ✅ Frontend server running successfully on port 3002
- ✅ Application loads without 404 errors
- ✅ All ESLint issues resolved
- ✅ Search form and UI components working properly

## Prevention
Always ensure both backend and frontend servers are running:
- Backend: `npm run dev` in `/backend` directory (runs on port 3001)
- Frontend: `npm run dev` in `/frontend` directory (runs on available port, e.g., 3002)

## Date
Fixed on: $(date)
